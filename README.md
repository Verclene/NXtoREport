# NXtoREport
Port maids from LittleMaidMobNX to LittleMaidReengaged

# What's this?
Littlemaid on "Reengaged" does not have compatibility with ones on "NX". This MOD helps you with porting from "NX" to "Reengaged".

# CAUTION
* Use this **AT YOUR OWN RISK**.
* This MOD hooks right-clicking maid. **If you does not want to port maids, do NOT install this MOD**!
* The caught maid **cannot be summoned on "NX" again**.

# How to use

1. Install this MOD to an environment in which "NX" is installed.
2. Right-click maid. You will read cautions on chat log.
3. Right-click maid again. Then the maid is caught to an "Maid Porter" item and it is put in player's inventory or dropped(if the inventory is full).
4. Open the world under an environment in which "Reengaged" is installed.
5. Right-click anywhere with "Porter". The caught maid will be summoned.
